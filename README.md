üçï This repo is just a bunch of NixOS [modules](https://github.com/ksevelyar/dotfiles/tree/master/modules), so you can pick or override anything.

üçï I use NixOS for [development](https://idempotent-desktop.netlify.app/vim.html), as a headless [router](https://github.com/ksevelyar/dotfiles/blob/master/modules/net/router.nix), for my tv (mostly `kodi`) and as a k8s node for my [atoms](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/59682/intel-atom-processor-d2500-1m-cache-1-86-ghz.html).

üçï You can use `tor` as a free socks5 proxy to bypass government blocks for selected sites.

üçï You can create your own [live usb](https://idempotent-desktop.netlify.app/live-usb.html)

üçï You can use these dotfiles in other unix too, check [home](https://github.com/ksevelyar/dotfiles/tree/master/home)
